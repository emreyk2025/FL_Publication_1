# Federated Learning for Smart Cities: Forecasting Short-term Residential Energy Consumption

This project aims to highlight the main advantages of federated learning in short-term energy consumption forecasting in residential buildings. We use the traditional centralized learning setting as the benchmark and assess the effectiveness of federated learning in privacy protection, computational efficiency, and predictive performance. In addition, local differential privacy adds an additional level of privacy protection by clipping model updates and adding noise to the parameters before sending them to the server. Our simulation scenarios include several state-of-the-art machine-learning models and diverse real-world energy consumption datasets from multiple cities around the world.

## Datasets:

- Smart Grid Smart City Customer Trial Data - Australia
- GoiEner Dataset - Spain
- METER UK Household Electricity and Activity Survey - UK
- SmartMeter Energy Consumption Data in London Households - UK
